{"name":"Shauryagupta.github.io","tagline":"Engineering Design Portfolio","body":"“Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish”, these four words, said by Steve Jobs as he concluded his commencement address at Stanford in 2005; have grown to define my aspirations and all that I yearn to be. At this point, connecting the dots backwards, I realize how childhood experiences and ambitions have paved the path to where I am today. My time spent at the University of Toronto has been quite eventful and experience gained, quite plentiful. This engineering design portfolio illustrates the beginning of what is yet to come.\r\n\r\nStudying amidst buildings of the Romanesque and gothic era, and being a part of a university, which taught great visionaries of the past, has been a lifelong dream. At U of T, with the help and support of world-class teachers, and renowned research facilities, I have been able to push my boundaries and achieve success in areas, that I could only dream of.\r\n\r\n- Shaurya Gupta","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
