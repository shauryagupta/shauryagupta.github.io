        <p>“Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish”, these four words, said by Steve Jobs as he concluded his commencement address at Stanford in 2005; have grown to define my aspirations and all that I yearn to be. At this point, connecting the dots backwards, I realize how childhood experiences and ambitions have paved the path to where I am today. My time spent at the University of Toronto has been quite eventful and experience gained, quite plentiful. This engineering design portfolio illustrates the beginning of what is yet to come.</p>

<p>Studying amidst buildings of the Romanesque and gothic era, and being a part of a university, which taught great visionaries of the past, has been a lifelong dream. At U of T, with the help and support of world-class teachers, and renowned research facilities, I have been able to push my boundaries and achieve success in areas, that I could only dream of.</p>
